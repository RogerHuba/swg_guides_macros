# The Warren

## Description
`Location` : The Warren is a POI on Dantooine. It is located at /way -555 -3825.

The Warren is a large theme park that can be accomplished rather quickly – being the second fastest theme park after Nym’s. Most do the Warren because you can receive two badges (Compassion and Imperial Hero) which count as two separate content badges (out of the three you need for Jedi).

To receive the “Imperial Hero” badge, you will need one Encryption Key, and four Evidence Disks.

### Walkthrough

#### Entering the Warren
- To begin this theme park, you must talk to the escapee outside of the Warren to get the passkey. They can be found at /way -558 -3735.
- After talking with them, the escapee should give you the `Main Entry Passkey` to enter the Warren.
- Upon entering the Warren, the first room you’ll find yourself in is filled with Huurton Howlers.
- Kill them and continue straight and down the hallway into the four doors room.

#### Passkeys
Note: Upon pickup of the required items, they are set on a respawn timer.

- Go to the farthest door on your right and follow it until you find a broken droideka at a T intersection.
- Go `RIGHT`. You should be in a room that contains lockers and beds. There should also be two corpses that you need to loot.
- One of the corpses will have a `Letter` and the other will have the `Master Control Room Elevator Control Passkey One`.
- Next, look for a lootable Locker, MagSeal Container, and Metal Chest. They should have the other three elevator passkeys in them.

#### Deactivating the Turret
After you have looted everything you need in the passkeys room:

- Head back out the door, go straight down the hall and to the `RIGHT`.
- Loot the corpse by the elevator to get the `Turret Sequence disk`.
- Go back out the door into the hallway.
- Turn `RIGHT TWICE` to end up back in the four doors room.
- Go through the door on your `RIGHT` and follow the hallway into the droid room.
- Kill all the droids in the room. From the door you entered the room from, you’re going to turn LEFT. This will lead you to into the turret controls room.
- Once in the turret controls room, stand in front of the Data Terminal across the room.
- Open your inventory, and inspect the Turret Sequence disk.
- A four digit code should pop up.
- Say the code exactly as shown in your Spatial chat tab.
- The Data Terminal should have green text over it that reads: “Turret Defense System has been Deactivated.”
- `To check` – you can inspect the Data Terminal. If it says the status is DEACTIVATED, you’re good to go. If it still shows it is ACTIVATED, inspect the Turret Sequence disk again and make sure the code didn’t change.

#### Activating the Elevators
- Head out of the room and back into the droid room.
- Hug the right wall and enter the farthest door to your `RIGHT`.
- Go straight to the droid room’s elevator.
- Take the elevator `UP`.
- Follow the hallway into the turret room (you’ll notice that there is no turret here – the turret disappears when it is deactivated).
- Go through the door on your `RIGHT`.
- You’ll enter another room with two hostile droids, and a small cage-like area close to the middle of the room – kill the droids.
- There are four `Passkey Terminals` around the room. Double-click each one to activate them.
