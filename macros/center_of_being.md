# Macro to Keep Ceter of Being Running as a Master

## Description

This macro will re-apply the center of being ability every 31 seconds. When you've not maxed your Center of Being duration, you should adjust the pause to match the duration of your relevant `Center Of Being Duration` Skill Mod. It may help to enable timestamps in chat by navigating to `Options > Chat tab > tick "Timestamp Incomming Messages"`, which will allow you to see how many seconds occur between Center of Being application and the buff dropping.

### Macro: `cob`

```swg
/center;
/pause 31;
/m cob;
```
